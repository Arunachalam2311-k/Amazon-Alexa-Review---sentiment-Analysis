# Amazon Alexa Review - sentiment Analysis

## About the Data

This dataset consists of a nearly 3000 Amazon customer reviews (input text), star ratings, date of review, variant and feedback of various amazon Alexa products like Alexa Echo, Echo dots, Alexa Firesticks etc. for learning how to train Machine for sentiment analysis.

## What you can do with this Data ?

You can use this data to analyze Amazonâ€™s Alexa product ; discover insights into consumer reviews and assist with machine learning models.You can also train your machine models for sentiment analysis and analyze customer reviews how many positive reviews ? and how many negative reviews ?

## project overview: 

I loaded the data and analyzed it. There were only a few null values, which I removed. Then, I visualized the data and analyzed it. Afterward, I preprocessed the data, applied scaling, and trained the models. Models like Random Forest, K-Fold Cross-Validation, XGBoost, and Decision Tree were trained and evaluated.

# Project Workflow: A Comprehensive Overview

# Data Loading and Analysis:

Loaded the dataset for analysis.
Inspected the dataset and identified null values.
Removed the null values to clean the data.

# Data Visualization:

Created various visualizations to analyze the dataset in detail.
The visualizations provided insights into data distribution and relationships between features.

# Data Preprocessing:

Performed necessary preprocessing steps to prepare the data for model training.
Applied feature scaling to normalize the numerical data for improved model performance.

# Model Training and Evaluation:

Trained multiple machine learning models, including:
* Random Forest: An ensemble learning method for improved accuracy.
* K-Fold Cross-Validation: Ensured robust model validation across different data splits.
* XGBoost: A highly efficient gradient boosting algorithm for accurate predictions.
* Decision Tree: Used for interpretability and feature analysis.
Evaluated the models using performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

This systematic workflow ensured a thorough understanding of the data and produced reliable model outcomes, making it a valuable approach for similar data analysis and machine learning tasks.
